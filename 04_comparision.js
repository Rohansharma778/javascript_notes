console.log(null>0);//when comparision  null becomes zero or a number so now null=0then is 0>0 no so false
console.log(null==0);//when == equality comes null becomes the string  valus is always 1 so 1==0 so false
console.log(null>=0);//here null is compared first so it is considered as 0 so is 0 greater of equal to 0 (not greater but equal to 0) so true it equal 0=0
console.log("2"===2);//strict checks the datatypes as well
